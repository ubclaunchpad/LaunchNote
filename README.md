## What it does
It's hard for students to keep track of all their materials for one course. LaunchNote will let you upload and organize photos of lecture slides, notes, and answer keys. Then using image processing, you can hover over a page in a textbook and the app will pull up the relevant documents. Bonus: export the photos.
